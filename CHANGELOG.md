# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- When running a program on the Prime Hub or Inventor Hub, it is saved on the
  hub's file storage. You can start this program again by pressing the center
  button.
- Added basic file read and write functionality to `pybricks.experimental`.
  This functionality is intended for debugging only and will disappear in
  a future release.

### Changed:
- Dropped `integral_range` argument from `Control.pid()`. This setting was
  ineffective and never used. When set incorrectly, the motor could get stuck
  for certain combinations of `kp` and `ki`.
- Improved motor behavior for cases with low-speed, low-load, but high
  inertia. ([support#366])

## [3.1.0b1] - 2021-08-21

### Added
- Support for LEGO Technic Color Light Matrix ([support#440]).
- Support for LEGO UART devices with a new battery power flag. This is
  required to support the new LEGO Technic Color Light Matrix ([support#440]).
- Support for the SPIKE Essential hub/Technic Small hub ([support#439]).

### Fixed
- Fixed Ultrasonic Sensor and Color Sensor turning off when a
  user script ends ([support#456]).
- Hub reset due to watchdog timer when writing data to UART I/O device
  ([support#304]).
- City/Technic hubs not connecting via Bluetooth on macOS 12 ([support#489]).

### Changed:
- Updated to MicroPython v1.17.

## [3.1.0a4] - 2021-08-30

### Added
- Enabled builtin `bytearray` ([pybricks-micropython#60]).
- Enabled `ustruct` module ([pybricks-micropython#60]).
- Added alpha support for dual boot installation on the SPIKE Prime Hub.
- Added `pybricks.experimental.hello_world` function to make it easier for
  new contributors to experiment with Pybricks using C code.
- Added ability to import the `main.mpy` that is embedded in the firmware from
  a download and run program ([support#408]).
- Added `pybricks.iodevices.LWP3Device` to communicate with a device that supports
  the LEGO Wireless Protocol 3.0.00 ([pybricks-micropython#68])

### Changed
- Move Hub Bluetooth optimizations to reduce firmware size ([pybricks-micropython#49]).
- Disabled `pybricks.iodevices` module on Move Hub to reduce firmware size.
- Improvements to `pybricks.pupdevices.Remote`:
  - Check if a remote is already connected before attempting to create a new
    connection.
  - Rename first argument from `address` to `name` to match documentation.
  - Implement connecting by name.
  - Add `name()` method.
  - Add `light` attribute.

## [3.1.0a3] - 2021-07-19

### Added
- Added `reset_angle=False` keyword argument to `Motor()` class.
  This makes resetting the angle optional, allowing to maintain absolute
  positioning for robots with gears ([support#389]).

### Changed
- Moved MicroPython `math` module to `umath` to be consistent with other
  MicroPython modules.

### Fixed
- Fixed City hub not always powering off on shutdown ([support#385]).
- Fixed Move hub turning back on after shutdown ([support#386]).

## [3.1.0a2] - 2021-07-06

### Added
- Support for reading button state on Technic Hub, City Hub, and Move Hub.
- Support for reading hub name on all Powered Up hubs.
- Enable MicroPython slicing feature on Technic Hub, City Hub, Prime Hub.
- Added pystone benchmark tests for all hubs.
- Added `hub.system.shutdown()` for graceful shutdown ([support#58]).

### Changed
- Move `Remote` class from `experimental` to `pupdevices`.
- Move `Remote.pressed()` to `Remote.buttons.pressed()`.
- Remove `pybricks.experimental` module on Move Hub.
- Increased Move Hub heap from 6K to 7K due to recently freed RAM ([pybricks-micropython#57]).
- Changed `hub.system.reset(action)` to accept `2` only ([support#379]). This
  is technically a breaking change, although this method was never officially
  released or documented. With this change, entering firmware update mode
  remains possible for backwards-compatibility, but unsafe power off methods
  are removed.

### Fixed
- Fix Bluetooth not disconnecting when shutting down and button is still pressed.
- Fix I/O ports not powering off when shutting down and button is still pressed.
- Fix version number only showing git hash and not v3.x.

## [3.1.0a1] - 2021-06-23

### Added
- Added PnP ID characteristic to Device Information Service and to advertising
  data ([pybricks-micropython#49]).
- Added special location in firmware for storing hub name ([support#52]). Note:
  Support will need to be added to tools separately to make use of this.
- Added configuration option to run a simplified version of motor PID control.
  It is activated on the Move Hub to reduce build size. Motor performance on
  the other hubs is unaffected.
- Experimental support for the Powered Up remote control ([support#186]).

### Changed
- Updated MicroPython to v1.16.
- Simplified the Powered Up UART Protocol host implementation. Unused device
  properties are no longer stored in order to reduce flash and RAM
  usage ([pybricks-micropython#57]).

## [3.0.0] - 2021-06-08

### Added
- Added `Hub.system` attribute ([support#321]).

### Changed
- `Hub.reset()` moved to `Hub.system.reset()` ([support#321]).
- Motor methods now raise `OSError` with `uerrno.EBUSY` instead of `uerrno.EPERM`
  if the motor is currently being used and the operation cannot be completed.

### Fixed
- Fixed resetting motor angle while holding position causes movement ([support#352]).
- Fixed `DriveBase` not resetting during initialization ([pybricks-micropython#21]).
- Fixed <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> stopping REPL when first started ([support#347]).
- Fixed UART I/O devices retuning uninitialized data ([support#361]).
